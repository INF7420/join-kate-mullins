# My INF 7420 Wireframes
Welcome to My Website - Kate Mullins
I am making a website that will serve as a personal portfolio for web development, as well as some artwork I’ve created.

## Wireframes
Each page will have a similar skeleton of header, navigation bar, and footer. The only thing that will vary from page to page is the main content. This is to create a feel of continuity and allow a relaxing browsing experience.
